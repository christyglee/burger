# Burger Logger Application

Burger is an application built to let users input the names of bugers they would like to eat. Whenever the user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page if they'd like to save it for later, or in this application's case `QUEUE IT!` -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the burger waiting area has an `OM NOM!` button. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the right side of the page displaying that it has been virtually devoured by the user.

The application will store every burger name in the database, whether it was devoured or not.
